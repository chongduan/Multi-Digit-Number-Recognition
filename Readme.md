# Information about all folders:
1. './checkpoints' folder contains weights for the multi-digit model (please refer to the report for details). You can also download it from: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ju3826r69xcmbvq/checkpoints.zip?dl=0
2. './heckpoints-pre-trained-VGG16' folder contains weights for VGG-based single-digit model. You can also download it from: https://www.dropbox.com/s/3l4eiwx0dvzibtn/checkpoints-pre-trained-VGG16.zip?dl=0
3. './data' folder contains a custom taken video for testing the proposed system
4. './graded_images' contains the five required output images


## Report

CS6476-ComputerVision-FinalProj-Report.pdf

## Run Code

To produce the image outputs for final grade, please run the run.py file within the main directory. It will process 5 selected frames from the input video, and output the final results to the './graded_images' folder. 

(On my laptop with a 8G Nvidia GPU, it takes about 5-10 seconds to process the 5 frames)
